# Omni Market Intelligence (OmniMI) SQL Project

This project contains a complete SQL schema for a retail intelligence system. It tracks customers, omnichannel transactions, web logs, and competitor market trends.

## Schema Highlights
* **Relational Mapping:** Connects customer demographics to detailed transaction line items.
* **Web Intelligence:** Structured to capture clickstream events and UTM campaign data.
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Includes a table for social media mentions and sentiment scoring.

## Getting Started
1. Run `OmniMI_Setup.sql` in SQL Server Management Studio.
2. The script will automatically create the database, tables, and populate them with sample data.
